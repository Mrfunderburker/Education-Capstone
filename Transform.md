# Data Transformations

1. In the Attendance and Graduation Data majority of the data is numeric, but its being treated as strings. I would change the objects to integers and/or floats. 

2. Merge both Attendance datasets together 

3. In the Graduation Data create a graduation year column based off the cohort year column
