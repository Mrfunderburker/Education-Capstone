# Data Transformations

1. In the Citywide Attendance Data majority of the data is numeric, but its being treated as strings. I would change the objects to integers and/or floats. This will make it easier to manipulate the data. 

2. In the Citywide Graduation Data remove school name as the entire column is null values

3. In the Citywide Graduation Data create a graduation year column based off the cohort year column 

4. In the Citywide Demographoic Data and Graduation Data will have to rename some columns to match to make it easier to merge.
